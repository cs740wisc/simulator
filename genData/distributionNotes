Assumptions
    number of nodes is constant     - 50
    number of objects is constant   - 25
    top k is constant               - 10


Inputs
    time        length of time to generate data for
    interval    average interval to wait before sending more data
       


Workloads we want
    
    random
        each node randomly generates each of the 25 keys
        
        generate at an average of 100/s each


Files consist of:
    [
        {
            'duration': 0 
            'freqs': [freqA, freqB, ... , freqY]
        },
        {
            'duration': 100   
            'freqs': [freqA, freqB, ... , freqY]
        }
